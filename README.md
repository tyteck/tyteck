### Hi there 👋

My name is Frédérick Tyteca and I'm a 🇫🇷️ backend developper currently living in a small village near Nice (on the french riviera).
I'm developping web applications for more than 20 years 😨 *(with a short parenthesis as a project manager)*.

- 📝 I'm currently developping remotely for [Actual](https://www.groupeactual.eu/).
- 🎡 I'm coding with Laravel, 🐘 (php), 🐋 (docker), ElasticSearch, html/css/javascript(vanilla)
- 👷 Maker of [Podmytube](https://www.podmytube.com) and [Feedurl](https://feedurl.link)
- 💬 Ask me about: podcasts, laravel, php, docker, elasticsearch.
- 📬 Reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ftyteca).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a big fan of alternative universe like Invincible or the Marvel MCU.
